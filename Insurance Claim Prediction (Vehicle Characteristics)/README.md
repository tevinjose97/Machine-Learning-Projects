## Objective: 
To develop a predictive model that uses vehicle characteristics to accurately predict insurance claim payments

## Method:
* Inspect the dataset
* Handle numerical, ordinal and categorical data
* Handle the imbalanced dataset using resampling strategies 
* Create various regressor models on the dataset and compare performance
* Create a tandem model combining a binary classifier and regressor
* Compare RMSE scores and choose the model with the best score (Lowest RMSE value)
